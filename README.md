## How do I approach designing software?

Working with OpenGL for the first time required the application of many new design skills.  The project was scaffolded with weekly milestones that helped learn techniques before applying them to our project.  Initially, we practiced creating and altering shape meshes.  We then learned textures, and soon after lighting.  I believe this approach could be applied to future projects as well, as it seemed like a logical sequence for a design in a 3D space.

## How do I approach developing programs?

Our week one assignment familiarized us with the space we'd be working in by having us run a sample.  Ultimately, the sample's codebase contained all of the tools we'd be using in the construction of our own 3D scenes.  By weaving in one of these design elements at a time with each iteration, we really had the opportunity to see how much impact they had on the scene as a whole.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

These lessons in computational graphics and visualizations have given me a great foundation to be improved on in any future courses or even careers that would involve working with 3D scenes.  This includes fields of interest such as animation, movie production, or video game development.
